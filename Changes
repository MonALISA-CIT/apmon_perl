    - Do not factor in CPU frequency fluctuations when reporting ksi2k values
    - Recognize TMPDIR as the default path where to put the temporary files instead of hardcoding /tmp/

2.2.18 Tue Feb 12 17:26:35 CET 2008
    - Enconding numbers larger than 2^31 as REAL instead of INT to preserve the actual value

2.2.17 Tue Nov 27 13:32:29 CET 2007
    - Fixed security issue: /tmp files were world writeable. Now 0600.

2.2.16 Tue Nov  6 15:43:20 CET 2007
    - Sending again the swap_used/free/usage parameters (broken since 2.2.11)
    - Avoid collecting BgMonitoring info immediately after initialization

2.2.15 Thu Nov  1 15:08:22 CET 2007
    - Finer-grained disk usage statistics (use df -k instead of df -m)
    - Simpler overflow check

2.2.14 Thu Oct  4 11:40:34 CEST 2007
    - If known, report also the ksi2k factor for the system (as generic info)

2.2.13 Mon Sep  3 10:23:40 CEST 2007
    - Reporting the size and success of the sent datagram
    - Fix for handling string params in sendToML.sh
    - Requiring LWP::Useragent only when needed, so if config is not on http, this is not required

2.2.12 Fri Aug 24 16:33:33 CEST 2007
    - Support changing generic values
    - Support variable CpuMhz when reporting consumed ksi2k
    - Adding reporting for minor and major faults of the processes of a monitored job

2.2.11 Mon Jul  2 18:05:43 CEST 2007
    - Adding swap_(in|out)_R also for kernel >2.5
    - Renaming pages_(in|out) to blocks_(in|out)_R and adding it also for kernel >2.5
    - adding cpu_iowait, interrupts and context_switches
    - adding sendToML.sh and servMon.sh scripts to the distribution

2.2.10 Tue Jun  5 18:16:00 CEST 2007
    - Fixed support for cpu type and parameters on ia64.
    - adding /etc/issue as a place to get distribution name

2.2.9 Tue Feb  6 10:44:48 CET 2007
    - fixed /tmp not accesible problem: sending both user and monitoring information was not
      working. Now, /tmp fails while running, old config is kept. In order to avoid all this,
      create ApMon(0) to avoid using bg processes.

2.2.8 Fri Sep  1 16:26:17 CEST 2006
    - added 2 functions: getSysMonInfo & getJobMonInfo to get the last values of all monitored 
      parameters from ApMon.

2.2.7 Mon Jul 31 16:05:39 CEST 2006
    - don't print an error if no config url is given (but there is a destination)
    - another fix in parsing uptime

2.2.6 Thu Jul  6 21:22:31 CEST 2006
    - small fix in handling errors when loading config from multiple urls
    - added a new example: muliple_urls.pl to show how to init from several urls

2.2.5 Mon Jun 26 12:01:41 CEST 2006
    - fix in parsing uptime
    - cpu_time is always increasing, even if one of the forked processes finishes
    - added run_ksi2k to report the elapsed time (not CPU time) in ksi2k units.

2.2.4 Tue Jun 13 11:54:50 CEST 2006
    - added mem_actualfree: actually free memory: free + buffers + cached

2.2.3 Tue May 30 19:12:04 CEST 2006
    - added cpu_cache - as in /proc/cpuinfo
    - added possibility to report cpu_ksi2k as cpu consumed power, per second, in Kilo SpecINT2000 units.

2.2.2 Wed May 24 22:43:52 CEST 2006
    - changed the Instance ID to be more random
    - added new parameters: kernel_version, platform, os_type, mem_buffers, mem_cached
    
2.2.1 Tue Mar 7 10:12:34 CET 2006
    - changed ps -ax -e to ps -A to avoid the warning on debian and to keep the consistency on Mac.

2.2.0 Sun Feb 19 21:52:52 CET 2006
    - Changed protocol (requires ML Service >= 2.4.10) so that each UDP packet includes 2 new INT32 fields
      to identify the sender and the sequence number. This will enable ML Service to detect lost packets,
      if it is configured to do so.

2.1.1 Mon Feb 13 23:07:39 CET 2006
    - sendBgMonitoring accepts now a parameter to force sending the bgMonitoring
      regardles of how much time passed since last sent
    - LoadAvg (load1, load5, load15) works on Darwin (Mac OS X)
    - Process monitoring works on Darwin (Mac OS X)
    - fixed reporting cummulative values (ethX_yyy, swap in/out, pages in/out, cpu_zzz)
    
2.0.10 Wed Dec  7 17:04:26 CET 2005
    - don't compute the used_swap and used_mem unless we have values for total and free mem and swap
    - added sockets info (tcp, udp, unix) and connection states for tcp sockets from netstat
    - sorted the list of sent parameters - it should be easier to find them in the GUI client
    - decreased the default max rate of sent messages to 20 per second
    
2.0.9 Sat Nov  5 21:45:41 CET 2005
    - don't try to encode parameters with undefined values

2.0.8 Thu Oct 27 21:49:57 CEST 2005
    - fixed div by zero if there is no swap space
    - produce the number of running, sleeping, io blocked, zombie, stopped processes

2.0.7 Mon Oct  3 22:25:58 CEST 2005
    - replaced `hostname -f` with Net::Domain::getfqdn() for Mac compatibility
    
2.0.6 Fri Sep  2 16:33:59 CEST 2005
    - added a limit of the maximum number of messages that are sent, per second
    - added a function to free the resources when you have to recreate the object
    - fixed a bug in computing the ethX_in/out network traffic when system counters were wrapping 

2.0.5 Sat Aug  6 18:40:45 CEST 2005
    - added number of opened file descriptors

2.0.4 Fri Jul 29 11:45:34 CEST 2005
    - added cpu_vendor_id, cpu_family, cpu_model, cpu_model_name, bogomips

2.0.3 Sun Jun 26 18:21:22 CEST 2005
    - added an example of how to send data from bash
    - by default, if bg monitoring is requested, send all available params
    - if you init ApMon object passing 0 as param, no fork will ever be done

2.0.2 Tue Apr 19 12:51:44 CEST 2005
    - removed job_ from job's parameters name

2.0.1 Thu Apr 14 13:16:27 CEST 2005
    - Clean up, change of major version
    - Added uptime parameter
    - Added setLogLevel and xApMon_loglevel to change the logging level
    - Created several examples

1.6.7 Thu Mar 31 22:49:08 CEST 2005
    - Made it compliant to the standard format for Perl packages

1.6.0 Beginning of March, 2005
    - Added xApMon extension to send background monitoring information.
